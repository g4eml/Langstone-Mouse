# Langstone-Mouse
## Description

The Langstone SDR transceiver project makes use of a standard mouse as the tuning control. The mouse scroll wheel is used as a tuning knob and the left and right mouse buttons select the tuning speed. Whilst it is possible to use the PCB from a cheap mouse and to connect an external panel mounted rotary encoder and push buttons there are some issues when trying to use encoders with a high number of pulses per revolution.
